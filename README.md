# Comechat-Front-End-Developement-Intership

Thank you for your interest in our internship opening. As a next step, we are expecting you to complete a short assignment.

- Visit github.com/cometchat (don’t forget to follow the org for updates)
- Select a sample app of your choice: https://github.com/cometchat?q=sample-app (we have 8 sample apps for you to choose
  from; you can do this assignment for up to 2 sample apps) (don’t forget to star them for easy bookmark and watch them to get latest updates)
- Fork the sample app to your Github account
- Sign up at https://app.cometchat.com with your Gmail ID and create an app (you can use a single account for multiple sample apps)
-- IMPORTANT: When signing up for CometChat, be sure to use a Gmail address with “+is1713783310” in it. For example, if your email address is “jay@gmail.com”, then signup with “jay+is1713783310@gmail.com”. If your email address is “amit0234@gmail.com”, then signup with “amit0234+is1713783310@gmail.com”.
- Use the app credentials from app.cometchat.com in your forked sample app (do not store them in the public repo; use them locally)
- Run the sample app
- Create a document with the following information:
1. Take screenshots of the app running
2. Report any bugs/errors/issues while compiling the app
3. Report any bugs/errors/issues when experiencing the app UI (you can check “Conversations with Messages” component after logging in)

Good luck!
